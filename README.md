## Getting Started


1. Clone the repository from github, if you have the repo, go to step 2.

2. Install Docker Desktop if you don't have it https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop (Skip if you have)
   **See the note below if you don't want to use Docker

3. Once you have Docker Desktop open a terminal and run `docker-compose up agile-rabbit-mq` This will download RabbitMQ and start the server!

4. Optionally, if we get this far, also install MongoDB with docker `docker-compose up agile-rabbit-mongo`

5. Run `npm install` at the root of the project, you're done!


**You will have to install RabbitMQ & MongoDB manually by downloading their install packages.
